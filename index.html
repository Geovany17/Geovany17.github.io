              <section class="card-text"> <em>I was born in Puerto Rico, But living in Philadelphia, PA since
                  2015.
                  When I first went to  college in 2011,
                  It was an institute call ICPR Junior College that prepares you for the CompTIA A+ exams, the computer technician certification. That's where my passion started to grow. Once I saw that, I have the skill of learning thins quickly. I decided to take one step further. But I went through a lot at that time. I became a father, so I had to quit college and keep working.
                  Then I started working in regular jobs until I started learning how to weld. After learning good welding skills, I manage to get a job as a welder at Eastern Catalytic.   But the IT field has always been my passion. Having a background as a computer hardware and repair technician,  I started to get interested in coding.
                  Then
                  I
                  said to my self you need to get to the other level. And I started taking online courses and teaching my self how to code.
                  When I first started learning how to code and built my first HTML file, I was hooked. The
                  internet
                  was
                  my outlet And I found a new way to learn, so I decided to join a coding "Bootcamp" Now I'm learning how to code correctly and new ways to show my passions.  I consider my self a team player, And I have lots of experience working with different teams in different roles.</em> </section>
